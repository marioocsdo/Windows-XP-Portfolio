# Windows-XP-Portfolio
:raising-hand: Welcome to my new Windows XP vibes-based portfolio!

I created this web on HTML, CSS & Js, just as a hobby project, but can be used as a window for all of you, HR people!
Hahaha, window, did you get it?

⚠️ Please, note that I'm not YET a professional web dev, so may there be some bugs.
As I post this, these are the known ones:
-  Sometimes, if there's only one window, it's not interactive. Can be fixed clicking on its tab in the navbar.
-  Resizing is not working as expected sometimes, it's a Js problem, but it's hard to fix, so bear with me.

  Did some debugging by myself, but as the page is written by me, I'm not the best tester for it, so
  if you find any more bugs, please tell me!

  Thank you and wish you like it!
